# Errata

This repo contains errata and improvement proposals for books.

## Goal

To have a common repository where we can share fixes or suggestions to books. We will be able to keep our books up to date with the last fixes, even before a new version is released (if that happens at all).

## Organization

Each book will have a separate file containing errata for the different versions of a book.

## PR

Feel free to submit a PR adding errors/improvements to any book (existent in the repo or new ones).

Feel also free to provide contact information for the authors, and to provide links to this repo to the authors so they can see the latest errors found by the community and luckily provide feedback through discussion in Issues or PRs.
